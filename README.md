## Description

This is another demo program for [DlxLib](https://github.com/taylorjg/DlxLib).
Initially, it is just a simple console app but I plan to write a WPF app
that allows a Sudoku puzzle to be entered and solved.

I have leaned heavily on the code listed below by [Alex Rudnick](https://code.google.com/p/narorumo/wiki/Alex).
